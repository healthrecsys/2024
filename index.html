         <h1>Objectives</h1>
         <div class="text-justify"
         <p>
            <b>Background:</b> The HealthRecSys workshop discussions over the years have spanned a broad spectrum of topics, reflecting the multifaceted nature of health recommender systems and the diverse applications and challenges of recommender systems in the health domain. Previous workshops encouraged discussions of the potential of recommender systems in the health domain, various new applications, associated challenges, and practical solutions for existing systems or scenarios. These discussions have not only introduced new challenges to the recommender system community but have also underscored the critical role of human oversight in ensuring the reliability and safety of health recommendations. The diversity of application domains discussed, from mental health to nutrition, and the variety of stakeholders involved, from patients to healthcare providers, underscore the complexity and importance of this research area.
             </p>
           <p> <b>Goals:</b> Our aim with the 6th HealthRecSys is to reignite these conversations and provide a forward-thinking platform that revisits the foundational elements that have contributed to the field's growth. However, the workshop aspires to do more by infusing new perspectives and tackling the most pressing global challenges and technological innovations head-on. The workshop will explore contemporary themes such as the impact of global health crises on recommender systems, the integration of Large Language Models and other generative AI models in health applications, the increasing emphasis on personalized and self-managed care, and the increasing focus on health equity leading to consideration of literacy, accessibility and monetary means when building health recommender systems. These topics not only reflect the current state of the world but also align with the broader shifts towards ethical AI, and the need for systems that can adapt to and address individual health and care needs. Furthermore, HealthRecSys is dedicated to strengthening the network of researchers working on health recommender systems, drawing participants from an array of health and care domains. This effort is aimed at cultivating a cross-disciplinary community that promotes collaboration among recommender systems specialists, healthcare professionals, ethicists, and policymakers, among others. To enhance cross-sector collaboration, the 6th HealthRecSys workshop will encourage joint projects and funding prospects, in addition to promoting the sharing of resources, datasets, and tools among scholars and industry practitioners.</p>

         <p>The workshop is calling for submissions on a wide array of topics within health recommender systems. This includes systems aimed at health promotion, preventive, curative care, and recommender systems that are health-aware. The scope of topics for the workshop is extensive, covering various aspects within the domain of health recommender systems and health-aware recommender systems, which include, but are not limited to:</p>

         <p><b>Title: "Health Personalisation: From Wellbeing to Medicine"</b></p>
         <p>  </p>
         <p><b>Abstract:</b><br>
            Current agenda of health personalisation and recommendation research mainly revolves around lifestyle and wellbeing. A number of works on personalised technologies for physical activity, food intake, mental support, health information consumption, and more have been presented at the HealthRecSys workshops and related conferences. While these mainly addressed the patient as the recipient of the personalised service, strikingly little attention has been paid to personalised medical applications targeting clinical users. In this talk, we turn the spotlight to such medical use cases and the advantages personalisation can bring there. We will overview the established health care processes and highlight the touch points, where personalised support can improve the clinician's decision making. Also, we will discuss the differences between patient- and clinician-facing personalisation, particularly focussing on transparency and explainability. All these will be exemplified with recent and ongoing projects in personalised health.

         <p><b>Bio:</b><br>
            Shlomo Berkovsky is a Computer Scientist, with theoretical and applied expertise in several areas related to human-centric applications of artificial intelligence. He leads the Precision Health stream of the Australian Institute of Health Innovation, which focusses on the application of machine learning methods to develop patient models and personalised predictions of diagnosis and care. He also studies how sensors and physiological responses can predict medical conditions, and how clinicians and patients interact with health technologies.
