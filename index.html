         <h1>Objectives</h1>
         <p>
            Recommendations are becoming evermore important in health settings with the aim being to assist people live healthier lives. Four previous workshops on Health Recommender Systems (HRS) have incorporated diverse research fields and problems in which recommender systems can improve our awareness, understanding and behaviour regarding our own, and the general public's health. At the same time, these application areas bring new challenges into the recommender community. Recommendations that influence the health status of a patient need to be legally sound and, as such, today, they often involve a human in the loop to make sure the recommendations are appropriate. To make the recommender infallible, complex domain-specific user models need to be created, which creates privacy issues. While trust in a recommendation needs to be explicitly earned through, for example,  transparency, explanations and empowerment, other systems might want to persuade users into taking beneficial actions that would not be willingly chosen otherwise. Multiple and diverse stakeholders in health systems produce further challenges. Taking the patient's perspective, simple interaction and safety against harmful recommendations might be the prioritized concern. For clinicians and experts, on the other hand, what matters is precise and accurate content. Healthcare and insurance providers and clinics all have other priorities. This workshop will deepen the discussions started at the four prior workshops and will work towards further development of the research topics in Health Recommender Systems.
         <p>Our aim is to enhance the results of the first two workshops in the following areas:
         <ul>
            <li>Elaborate discussion topics of the previous workshops on health promotion, health care as well as methods
            <li>Strengthen the community of researchers working on Health in RecSys
            <li>Attract representatives from e.g. health, psychology, medicine, nutrition, fitness
            <li>Find cross-domain collaboration projects and funding targets
            <li>Exchange and share infrastructure (datasets and tools)
         </ul>
         </p>
         <p>We invite submissions that may include the following topics, but are not limited to:
         <ul>
            <li>Algorithms and Recommendation Strategies
            <li>Domain Knowledge Representation
            <li>Regulations and Standards
            <li>Medical Evaluation Techniques
            <li>User Profiling
            <li>Pervasive Systems
            <li>Personalization
            <li>Behavioral Interventions
            <li>Persuasion/Nudging/Behavioral Change
            <li>Gamification and Serious Games
            <li>Adherence
            <li>Empowerment
            <li>Trust
            <li>Explanations
            <li>Patient Needs/ Satisfaction
            <li>User Interaction Design
            <li>Human/ Expert-in-the-Loop
            <li>Privacy
            <li>Ethics
         </ul>
         </p>
         <p>The goal of this workshop is to share and discuss research and projects that reach beyond classic recommender techniques and discuss health domain related challenges of recommender systems.</p>

         <p><b>Title: "Health Personalisation: From Wellbeing to Medicine"</b></p>
         <p>  </p>
         <p><b>Abstract:</b><br>
            Current agenda of health personalisation and recommendation research mainly revolves around lifestyle and wellbeing. A number of works on personalised technologies for physical activity, food intake, mental support, health information consumption, and more have been presented at the HealthRecSys workshops and related conferences. While these mainly addressed the patient as the recipient of the personalised service, strikingly little attention has been paid to personalised medical applications targeting clinical users. In this talk, we turn the spotlight to such medical use cases and the advantages personalisation can bring there. We will overview the established health care processes and highlight the touch points, where personalised support can improve the clinician's decision making. Also, we will discuss the differences between patient- and clinician-facing personalisation, particularly focussing on transparency and explainability. All these will be exemplified with recent and ongoing projects in personalised health.
