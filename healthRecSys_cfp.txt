Objectives & Topics:
====================
Background: The HealthRecSys workshop discussions over the years have spanned a broad spectrum of topics, reflecting the multifaceted nature of health recommender systems and the diverse applications and challenges of recommender systems in the health domain. Previous workshops encouraged discussions of the potential of recommender systems in the health domain, various new applications, associated challenges, and practical solutions for existing systems or scenarios. These discussions have not only introduced new challenges to the recommender system community but have also underscored the critical role of human oversight in ensuring the reliability and safety of health recommendations. The diversity of application domains discussed, from mental health to nutrition, and the variety of stakeholders involved, from patients to healthcare providers, underscore the complexity and importance of this research area.

Goals: Our aim with the 6th HealthRecSys is to reignite these conversations and provide a forward-thinking platform that revisits the foundational elements that have contributed to the field's growth. However, the workshop aspires to do more by infusing new perspectives and tackling the most pressing global challenges and technological innovations head-on. The workshop will explore contemporary themes such as the impact of global health crises on recommender systems, the integration of Large Language Models and other generative AI models in health applications, the increasing emphasis on personalized and self-managed care, and the increasing focus on health equity leading to consideration of literacy, accessibility and monetary means when building health recommender systems. These topics not only reflect the current state of the world but also align with the broader shifts towards ethical AI, and the need for systems that can adapt to and address individual health and care needs. Furthermore, HealthRecSys is dedicated to strengthening the network of researchers working on health recommender systems, drawing participants from an array of health and care domains. This effort is aimed at cultivating a cross-disciplinary community that promotes collaboration among recommender systems specialists, healthcare professionals, ethicists, and policymakers, among others. To enhance cross-sector collaboration, the 6th HealthRecSys workshop will encourage joint projects and funding prospects, in addition to promoting the sharing of resources, datasets, and tools among scholars and industry practitioners.

The workshop is calling for submissions on a wide array of topics within health recommender systems. This includes systems aimed at health promotion, preventive, curative care, and recommender systems that are health-aware. The scope of topics for the workshop is extensive, covering various aspects within the domain of health recommender systems and health-aware recommender systems, which include, but are not limited to:

** Accessibility, Usability, and Augmented Decision-Making
** Adherence and Patient (User) Compliance
** Algorithms and Recommendation Strategies

Submissions:
============
We solicit short research papers (4-6 pages) and short position papers (2 pages + references), both in the ACM conference paper style-double-column format. Participants can decide between a research-focused submission and a project-focused submission.

Submission category research: innovative research ideas, preliminary findings, or system prototypes that contribute new knowledge to the field

Submission category project: presentations on funded research initiatives, collaborations between industry and academia, or partnerships between healthcare entities and research institutions.

Submission guidelines:
======================

All submitted papers must:

** be written in English;
** contain author names, affiliations, and email addresses;
** be formatted according to the ACM SIG Proceedings Template -double-column format, with a font size no smaller than 9pt;
** be in PDF (make sure that the PDF can be viewed on any platform), and formatted for US Letter size;

Submissions are encouraged to include links or demos as attachments to enhance their presentation. All submissions will undergo a rigorous peer-review process to ensure quality and originality. It is imperative that submitted works are not concurrently under review at any other conference, workshop, or journal and contain original, unpublished contributions. Accepted papers will be published according to the ACM RECSYS 2024 WS publication rules, with prior proceedings having been published in CEUR workshop proceedings.

A Few Remarks
=============
**  The title of the paper, authors, and the author order cannot be changed
after the acceptance
** Major changes to the text of the reviewed and accepted papers are not
permitted after the review
** At least one of the authors should participate in the workshop, register
in the RecSys conference, and personally present the paper in the workshop.
